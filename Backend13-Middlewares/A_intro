Middleware is an intermediatory between client and server.
Middleware in express are functions that come into play after the server receives the request and before the response is sent to the client.
Common Middleware functions are:
    methodOverride
    bodyParser
    express.static
    express.urlencoded


We can also define our own middlewares.
Middlewares can access our request body and response object.
Chaining is possible in middlewares.A middleware funtion can pass contron to other middleware function and so on..
A Middleware can also break this chaining by sending a response.
