For getting all the data of a collection we write command -> db.collectionName.find()
This will return all the data present in this collection

For specific queries
For getting of all the documents where city is multan we write command -> db.collection.find({city:"Multan"})
Then this will return all the documents where cith is multan

And if we want to find data of a single document where cith is multan then command -> db.collectionName.findOne({city:"Multan"})

We can also pass multiple conditions for finding a specific data.For example we want to find all the documents where city is multan and age is 19 then -> db.collectionName.find({city:"Multan" , age:19})

db.collectionName.find() methods retunrs a cursor(an array of documents is returned in result.Even if there is a single document which is returned then it will also be present in an array like [{}] ) and we also loop on it.
But our db.collectionName.findOne() returns only a single document
