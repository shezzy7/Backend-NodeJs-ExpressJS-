Like in sql mongodb also contians many operators.Like operators for applying conditions on queries.
We can go on -> https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/ 
for seeing different type of operators.

Example we want to find documents where marks are greater then 75 -> db.collectionName.find({marks:{$gt:75}})
we write our operator's name with a $ sign.

So like this we have many comparison operatores , logical , element , evaluation , Geospatial , Array , bitwise , Projection operators , Miscellaneous Operators and many more. We can find all of these on like above.

If we want to print to document where marks are greater then 80 or city is multan -> db.connectionName.find({$or:[{marks : {$gt:75}} , {city:"Multan"}]})
