//Interpolation refers to embeding expressions into marked up text.
//Embeding refers to fitting something into another.As we use templete literals for using variable in our strings like `welcome to ${varName}`
//Just like temaplate literals in javascript we can also use this type of funtionality in our html using ejs tags
//A popular tag is <%= %>
//If in our simple html tag h1 we write <h1> 1+2</h1> then on output screen we will se '1+2'
//But if we write it as <h1> <%= 1+2 %> </h2> then on output screen we will se '3'.
//Mean it helps in making our output dynamic according given data , it manipulates data before printing it.
