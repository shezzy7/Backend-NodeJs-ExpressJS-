In our ejs files we can also include other files.Mean if we want to include a complete ejs file in another file then we can do this by using an ejs tag -> <%-
This tag outputs the unescaped value into the template.Mean as we see tag <%= converts the value of variables inside it to strign and print it on html page.But this tag <%- does not converts the given files data into a string instead it converts it into a unescaped value mean original form of data as it is presnet in file(html code).
For example we add head of html code in every file.But if we place head's code in a file and then using this tag we can add head in each html file instead of writing whole head's code.
