CRUD => CRUD stands for create ,read , update ,delete.
For performing these operations on our data we use following verbs :-
    GET : retrieves resources
    POST : submits new data to the server
    PUT : updates existing data
    PATCH : updates existing data partially
    DELETE : removes data
So we use these request methods for performing operation like create,read , update , delete
So in this chapter , following things are done -> we will create a page for example quora.There we will ad functionalities of writing post , editing those posts , viewing detail of each post and deleting a post.And for building all these functionalities we going to write our restfull APIs.
Resource :-  That thing on which we are going to perform our crud operations.Like posts here.Tweets on twitter is a kind of resource.If we are writing apis for users then users are our resource.So as here we are manipulating with posts here so posts are our resources.
