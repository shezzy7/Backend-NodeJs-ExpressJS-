OOP stands for object oriented programming.
Basically it is a way of writing programms in a good way for managing complex tasks.
For example if we want to do a task several time then instead of writing code for eac task separately we create a blueprint and then use this blueprint for others.
For example if we want to create a bank system , in this system for each bank acount we store basic info of each account like username , account balance , debit card info , credit card info etc.So for writing code for each acount creation we can create a blueprint which will store all this info and we will use it for each acount.Here in terms of OOP we take this blueprint as Class and each entity(eg . account) as object.And all the atrributes(name,ac balance etc) are embeded in this class.We also create funtions inside this blurprint for performing operations like adding balance in someone's account or withdrawing etc and these are called methods.We can made as many attributes as many we want.And each object will have access to its attributes separately.
