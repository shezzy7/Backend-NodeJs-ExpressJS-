An object named as 'process' is present in our REPL.This object contains many properties we can check them by writing process in our REPL.
Process provides information about,and control over,the current node.js process.

This process contains a property 'argv'.It contains two values one is node path and other is arguments which we got by repl.
process.argv returns an array containing command line arguments passed when the node.js process was launched.
