For exporting files from a directory to another we use a simmliar but a little diffrent method.
In directory from where we want to export files we create a index.js file and import all other files in this file.
And then combine all those files in an array in index file from there export this file which contains all the files in it.
Now in directory where we want to import these files we just write require("directoryNameFromWhereWeWantToImportFiles") and it will do what? it will start searching file with name index.js will import data exported from it.
index file works like a entry point as main function in java/cpp etc.
