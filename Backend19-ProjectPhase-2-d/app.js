    //So if we go to express documentation and there go to cookie and see options that we can pass to cookies we will an option expires and maxAge.In these variables we can set time for which our cookie will store given data.Bydefult expiry date for cookies in maximum browsers is that when someone exits from browser then cookies are expired,but we can set our expiry date.
